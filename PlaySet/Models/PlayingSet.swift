     It’d probably good MVC design not to hardwire specific color names or shape names
     (like diamond or oval or green or striped) into the property names in your Model code.
     As you can see with this assignment (where we’re using ▲●■ instead of the standard
     shapes and shading instead of striping, etc.), the colors, shapes, etc., are really a UI
     concept and have nothing to do with the Model.
